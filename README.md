### Description

* ID = a unique identifier for each test subject
* Age = age of the test subject
* Gender = male or female
* Bedtime = the time the test subject goes to bed each night
* Wakeup time = the time the test subject wakes up each morning
* Sleep duration = the total amount of time the test subject slept (in hours)
* REM sleep percentage = the percentage of total sleep time spent in REM sleep
* Deep sleep percentage = the percentage of total sleep time spent in deep sleep
* Light sleep percentage = the percentage of total sleep time spent in light sleep
* Awakenings = the number of times the test subject wakes up during the night
* Caffeine consumption = the amount of caffeine consumed in the 24 hours prior to bedtime (in mg)
* Alcohol consumption = the amount of alcohol consumed in the 24 hours prior to bedtime (in oz)
* Smoking status = whether or not the test subject smokes
* Exercise frequency = the number of times the test subject exercises each week
* Which will let us determine the target variable which is:
* Sleep efficiency = a measure of the proportion of time in bed spent asleep
